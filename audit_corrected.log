/home/meisam/code/co-pfn-v4/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/transformer.py:531: UserWarning: The PyTorch API of nested tensors is in prototype stage and will change in the near future. We recommend specifying layout=torch.jagged when constructing a nested tensor, as this layout receives active development, has better operator coverage, and works with torch.compile.
